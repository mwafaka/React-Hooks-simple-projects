Assignment 1 - storing a promise in a variable

Below you will find a function which returns a Promise

Write some code which:

1. Calls the function "loadMusicTrack" and stores the result (the Promise object) in a variable

2. Call the method "then" on your variable

3. Pass a callback into the method "then". Inside the callback, call the console method console.log() to display a message that the Promise has been resolved

4. Test the application

*/

function loadMusicTrack() {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {

        setTimeout(() => {

            resolve();

        }, 4000);

    });
}

const myPromise = loadMusicTrack() ;
myPromise.then(()=>{
    console.log(' resolved....');
})
