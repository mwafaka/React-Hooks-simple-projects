Assignment 7 - Creating an error

In this exercise, you will be creating an Error object

1. Instantiate the "Error" constructor object using the "new" keyword. Use the message "No graphic was provided" in the Error.

> Hint: Error is a constructor, just like a class or a Promise, or Date

2. Test your code to see what happens

*/
const error = new Error('No graphic was provided');
console.log(error);
//throw error;
